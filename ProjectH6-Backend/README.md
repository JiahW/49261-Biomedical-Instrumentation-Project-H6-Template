**Project H6: Health-based mobile app**

iPhone and Android phone can be used to display real-time vital biosignals such as ECG, EMG and EEG. The information can then be used to evaluate physiological status or medical conditions such as mental fatigue, emotion or cardiac conditions.

Develop an app using an iPhone or a Android phone for displaying real-time biosignals and identifying a physiological status or a medical condition.

If you have any question please create a new issue in this repository or [email me](mailto:xu.lian@uts.edu.au) and I will reply as soon as possible.

Happy Coding :heart:
